## Description of the codebase üíª
* The Functionality of the app was written using kotlin in the MainActivity class

* The UI of the app was created using xml
  * The layout that was used was the constraint layout which allows for easy arrangement of the views in the layout.
  * The different views used was Material-Card view,Circle-Image view, Textview, Imageview and Scroll View

* All the texts and other language translations were stored in the strings folder

## Description of Design üé®
* The profile picture, name, username, title and the social media links are housed in a cardview
* The User should click on the gmail, Twitter, Github and linkedin icons to get access to each individual social media links respectively
* There is a scrollable feature that allows the User to see content that is not shown on the screen
* All main headers like(About Me, My Skills, What I Offer To Your Company) all have the same fontSize[24sp], fontStyle[baloo_thambi], color[#2B6797],
  for consistency and simplicity.The interface is deliberately kept simple and cool so there's not too much happening on the screen visually so the user can focus on reading the resume.
